According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram):

>A cryptogram is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text. Generally the cipher used to encrypt the text is simple enough that cryptogram can be solved by hand. Frequently used are substitution ciphers where each letter is replaced by a different letter or number. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines.

An example would be:

    'Q DWW HVTW JRLS OFW ORWW OFRLUIF OFW GFLO JVJOM JWWO LUO.'
	
	
Whose solution would be:

    'A BEE LINE FROM THE TREE THROUGH THE SHOT FIFTY FEET OUT.'
