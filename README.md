The Language Sandbox
--------------------

Pretty much, this is my way of learning functional paradigms. Build something that isn't too hard for me to pull off in Python, and attempt to write it as best I can in one or two functional languages. I will try to follow the idioms as best I can, please post pull requests and leave comments if you're bored and are good at Haskell.

There are two text files containing words of the English language included in the root of the repository as encouragement to utilize them in your problem ideas. 

Guidelines
----------

1. The size of the problems must be enough to benefit from unit tests.
2. All entries must include unit tests.
3. The difficulty of the problems should take a day or so to do properly.
4. The complexity of the problems should discourage solutions by brute force.
5. All entries should follow the tenants of good style for their language.
6. Clarity is more important than speed or efficiency.

> Although you may include more elegant entries alongside a clear example.
